Therapy and surgeries:-
* Cryosurgery
* Electrocautery
* Curettage
* Ablation
* cryotherapy

Warning Sign:-

* Location: The growths are most commonly found on the scalp, shoulder, chest, abdomen, or back. They are never found on the soles of the feet or palms of the hands.
* Texture: Lesions usually start off as small, rough bumps, and they gradually get thicker and develop a warty surface. They can sometimes appear waxy and "stuck on."
* Shape: They are usually round or oval.
* Color: Most are brown, but they can be yellow, black, or white.

Risk factors:-
* Sunlight: Lesions commonly appear on parts of the body that are more exposed to sunlight. 
* Ultraviolet (UV) light may play a role. However, they can develop in areas rarely exposed to sunlight, so this is not the whole answer.
* Genetics: Seborrheic keratosis seems to run in families. Scientists have suggested that a genetic mutation could be responsible.
* Age: They are more likely to develop in those aged 50 years or above.
