Precaution:-
* Never Intentionally Expose Your Skin to the Sun. There is no such thing as a 'healthy' tan.
* Wear Sunscreen. Make sunscreen a daily habit. UV radiation can still damage skin even in the winter and on cloudy days. Use broad-spectrum sunscreen (protects against UVA and UVB rays) with SPF of at least 30.  
* Wear Protective Clothing. Protect your body with sun-protective clothing, hat, and sunglasses.

* Avoid Peak Rays. Seek shade during the mid-day sun, when the sun's rays are most intense.
* Don't Use Tanning Beds. Indoor tanning has been shown to increase the risk of melanoma by up to 75%. Melanoma is one of the top three cancers diagnosed in young adults (ages 25-29), and scientists attribute this trend to the use of tanning beds among this age group, particularly young women.
* Protect Children. Children are particularly vulnerable to damage from UV rays. Just one bad sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles your child's chances of developing melanoma later in life.

Risk factors:-
* Unprotected or excessive UV exposure from the sun or indoor tanning.
* Weakened immune system due to a medical condition or medications.
* Many moles: The more moles you have on your body, the higher your risk for melanoma. Also, having large moles (larger than a tip of a pencil eraser), or any atypical moles, increases the risk for melanoma.
* Fair skin: Melanoma occurs more frequently in people with fair skin, light eyes and light or red hair.
* Skin cancer history: People who have already had melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancers run a greater risk of developing melanoma in the future.
* Genetics: Melanoma can run in families - one in every 10 patients has a family member who also has had the disease.
Warning Sign:-
* Look for anything new, changing or unusual on both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas of the body.
* commonly appear on the legs of women, and the number one place they develop on men is the trunk.
* Most moles, brown spots and growths on the skin are harmless
