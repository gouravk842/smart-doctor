Surgical procedures:- 
* Chemical peel: The physician applies a chemical to the face, causing the top skin layers to peel off. New skin generally regrows within a few weeks.
* Cryosurgery: The physician applies liquid nitrogen to freeze the tissue, which eventually falls off, allowing healthy skin to emerge.
* Curettage and desiccation: The physician scrapes or shaves off the lesion, then uses heat or a chemical agent to destroy remaining AK cells and stop any bleeding.
* Laser surgery: The physician applies a laser beam to vaporize the AK lesion.

Approved medications:-

* 5-fluorouracil (Carac(r), Efudex(r), Fluoroplex(r))

Precaution:-
* Check yourself head to toe once a month: Keep an eye out for new or evolving spots or lesions that persist, grow or bleed. If you notice any warning signs, see a dermatologist. Learn how to check your skin here.
* See your dermatologist every year for a professional skin exam. Having a specialist who is skilled at identifying and treating abnormal skin growths is vital to your health and wellness. Anyone who has AKs should be under a dermatologist's care.
* Practice sun-safe habits: A complete sun protection strategy is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of developing AKs. Avoid unprotected UV exposure. Seek the shade, especially between 10 AM and 4 PM, use a broad-spectrum (UVA)/UVB) sunscreen and wear sun-protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat and UV-blocking sunglasses.
Risk Factors
* History of unprotected exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or indoor tanning. This includes people who work outdoors in the sun, people with a bald scalp or thinning hair and those who have had sunburns.
* Geographic location: The closer to the equator you live, the more likely you are to have AKs.
* Weakened immune system due to a medical condition or medications.
* Fair skin: While anyone can develop AKs, they occur far more frequently in people with fair skin.
Age over 40: AKs are most common in people age 40 and older.
