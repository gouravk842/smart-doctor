Risk factors:-
* Fair skin. Anyone, regardless of skin color, can get squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 
* Excessive sun exposure. Being exposed to UV light from the sun increases your risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
* Use of tanning beds. People who use indoor tanning beds have an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
* A history of sunburns. Having had one or more blistering sunburns as a child or teenager increases your risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin as an adult. Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor.
* A personal history of precancerous skin lesions. Having a precancerous skin lesion, such as actinic keratosis or Bowen's disease, increases your risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
* A personal history of skin cancer. If you've had squamous cell carcinoma of the skin once, you're much more likely to develop it again.
* Weakened immune system. People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of skin cancer.
* Rare genetic disorder. People with xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes an extreme sensitivity to sunlight, have a greatly increased risk of developing skin cancer.

Precaution:-

* Avoid the sun during the middle of the day. For many people in North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.
* Wear sunscreen year-round. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours - or more often if you're swimming or perspiring.
* Wear protective clothing. Cover your skin with dark, tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs, and a broad-brimmed hat, which provides more protection than does a baseball cap or visor.
* Avoid tanning beds. Tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer.
* Check your skin regularly and report changes to your doctor. Examine your skin often for new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp.
