Approved medications

* 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Efudex(r), Carac(r), Fluoroplex(r), Tolak(r))

Therapy and surgeries
* Curettage and electrodesiccation (electrosurgery)
* Mohs surgery
* Excisional surgery
* Cryosurgery
* Laser surgery


Surgical procedures:- 

* Chemical peel: The physician applies a chemical to the face, causing the top skin layers to peel off. New skin generally regrows within a few weeks.
* Cryosurgery: The physician applies liquid nitrogen to freeze the tissue, which eventually falls off, allowing healthy skin to emerge.
* Curettage and desiccation: The physician scrapes or shaves off the lesion, then uses heat or a chemical agent to destroy remaining AK cells and stop any bleeding.
* Laser surgery: The physician applies a laser beam to vaporize the AK lesion.

Precaution
* Be on the lookout: Pay particular attention to any previously treated site, note changes and consult with your dermatologist. If the BCC does return, your doctor may recommend a different type of treatment, such as Mohs surgery, a highly effective way to prevent and treat recurrences.
* Check yourself head to toe: Look for new or changing lesions that grow, bleed or do not heal. Learn how to check your skin.
* See your dermatologist annually for a professional skin exam. Self-exams do not take the place of a specialist who is skilled at identifying and treating abnormal skin growths.
* Follow up: If you've already had either BCC or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or a precancer like actinic keratosis, be sure to see your doctor at recommended intervals.
* Be sun-safe every day of the year: Avoid unprotected UV exposure, seek the shade, especially when the sun is strongest and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen, a wide-brimmed hat and UV-blocking sunglasses. Safeguarding yourself every day is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of developing skin cancer. Get more skin cancer prevention guidelines.
Risk factors
* UV exposure from the sun or indoor tanning.
* History of skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or melanoma.
* Age over 50: Most BCCs appear in people over age 50.

* Male gender: Men are more likely to develop BCC.
* Chronic infections and skin inflammation from burns, scars and other conditions.
